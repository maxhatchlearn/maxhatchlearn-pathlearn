| name         | Dot Produt in Ruby
| statement    | One may also chain method invocations by simply adding more periods and method names sequentially - each method in the chain is called on the result of the previous method. Go on and try it by invoking next twice on 1 to get 3.
| explanation  | The results you're looking at are the consequence of running a series of tests against your input to validate it. If you see results coloured red, this means one or more tests failed. Green means you're good to go.
| language     | Ruby
| start        |x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [10, 10, 10]
def dot_product(x, y)
  #insert your code here
end
dot_product(x, y)
| solution     | 1.next.next
| output       | 3
| description  | next called on 1 twice returns three
